# unique_person_counter
This project integrate human detection &amp; tracking models to detect the accurate number of people present in a scene. One big struggle of object trackers is that the trackers cannot remember whether an object has appeared before. This is solved using BoT-SORT's ReID procedure. This ensures the same person retains he/her ID when they reappear.
